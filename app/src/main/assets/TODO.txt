TODO list:

For MVP:
- [done] Add in an explicit service layer, rather than just having the activities -- the services should act as a sort of API
- [done] Add in a loading screen with a progressbar that does all the calls and processing
- [cancelled] The error screen for serious errors should have a button that doesn't exit the app, but allows to redirect back to the front page
- [done] Very serious errors should just crash the app
 - Actually, very serious errors should just show up as a toast on the results display activity
- [done -- N.B. all keys could be null] Deserialize the model properly and document with comments which keys could be null/not null
- [done] Add in a cache so that the app does not need to make nearly as many UWaterloo API calls
- [done] If on a weekend, the app should report whether there are any classes or not on that day, rather than round to Monday
- [done] Classes that are empty for the whole day should be reported first and foremost
- Hand-filter the list of empty rooms to a recognizable collection so that no one walks in to a lab room
- [done] Change the colour scheme to Waterloo-like colours

For next version:
- Choosing a building and choosing a time should be put in two separate activities to reduce compactness of the UI
- Add in an option to select the day within the next two weeks (default today) especially for biweekly schedules or weekend searches
- Decide whether to cache the JSON or something else
- Put strings into a strings file so that the app can also be in Mandarin

- Add in a settings page (accessible from the first screen)
 - The page has the following:
 - Verbosity
  - display before/after classes (to know which class follows/precedes a gap) (checkbox)
 - Presentation (radiobutton group)
  - Display gaps by longest duration first (radiobutton)
  - Display gaps in chronological order (radiobutton)
